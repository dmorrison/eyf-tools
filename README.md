# Running the Scripts

You'll need Python 3 installed.

Then, one way is to install the needed dependencies in a virtual environment and run a script from within that:

```
# Set up the virtual environment.
python3 -m venv env

# Activate it.
source env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the desired script.
python MortgageRefinanceDecisionTemplate.py

# When done, deactive the virtual environment.
deactivate
```
